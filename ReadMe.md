Slot Machine Game

Rules of Slot Machine Game:

The user deposits a certain amount of coins, to begin with. The game continues until the user runs out of coins (through losses) or decides to walk away with their current funds. The user in each round of the slot machine decides how many lines (rows) they want to place their wager on, and how many coins they want to wager on each line. For instance, a user wagering 2 coins on 2 lines is wagering 4 coins. The slot machine is then spun. Note that the number of lines you wagered on is decided from the top. For instance, if you only wagered on 1 line and the second row is a match "A | A | A" let us say, then you will not win anything. However, you would have won something if you had wagered on 2 lines. The user's funds are settled according to the current round.

The multiplier values for matching different values (based on probabilities) are:
<ol>
    <li>\$: 4,</li>
    <li>B: 3,</li>
    <li>8: 2,</li>
    <li>A: 1</li>
</ol>
     
For instance, if you put a wager of 2 coins on a row and that row gets matching signs like "\$ | \$ | \$", then you get 4 coins multiplied by your investment (4 * 2 = 8) back for that particular row.
